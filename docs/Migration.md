## Migrating to 1.24

In version 1.24 the dsl for the build timeout plugin has been modified and the
generated xml requires a newer version of the build timeout plugin.
The old dsl still works but has been deprecated.

DSL prior to 1.24
```groovy
timeout(String type) { //type is one of: 'absolute', 'elastic', 'likelyStuck'
    limit 15       // timeout in minutes
    percentage 200 // percentage of runtime to consider a build timed out
}

timeout(35, false)
```

DSL since 1.24
```groovy
timeout {
   absolute(15)
   failBuild()
   writeDescription('Build failed due to timeout after {0} minutes')
}

timeout {
    absolute(35)
    failBuild(false)
}
```

Before 1.24, GerritTrigger configuration used hardwired configuration for not set label configurations (successfulVerified +1, failedVerified -1, everything else 0, these the default values of the central gerrit trigger plugin configuration). Now GerritTrigger configuration correctly honors central configuration of labels. If you use non-default labels in your central configuration, you might need to change the trigger label configuration of your jobs.



See the [[Job Reference]] for further details.

## Migrating to 1.20

In version 1.20, some implementation classes have been moved to work around a [bug](http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/GROOVY-5875) in Groovy. When these classes have been used to [extend the DSL](Extending-the-DSL-from-your-Job-Scripts), import statements and fully qualified class names have to be adjusted.

## Migrating to 1.19

In version 1.19 all build wrapper elements have been moved from the job element to a wrappers sub-element. When upgrading to 1.19 or later, the wrapper elements have to moved as shown below.

DSL prior to 1.19:

```groovy
job {
    ...
    runOnSameNodeAs 'other', true
    rvm 'ruby-1.9.2-p290'
    timeout 60
    allocatePorts('PORT_A', 'PORT_B')
    sshAgent 'deloy-key'
    ...
}
```

DSL since 1.19:

```groovy
job {
    ...
    wrappers {
        runOnSameNodeAs 'other', true
        rvm 'ruby-1.9.2-p290'
        timeout 60
        allocatePorts('PORT_A', 'PORT_B')
        sshAgent 'deloy-key'
    }
    ...
}
```
