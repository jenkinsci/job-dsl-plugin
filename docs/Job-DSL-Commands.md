# Job Factory
The DSL execution engine exposes only one method, called 'job'. This 'job' method implies the creation of a Jenkins job and the closure to this method then further exposed some methods where things get interesting. See the later sections to learn the specific available methods available, for when a DSL helper method isn't available, look to the [configure block](The Configure Block). Below is the simplest job possible:

```groovy
job {
    name 'Simplest Job Possible'
}
```

Because the engine is just Groovy, you can call other Groovy classes available in the workspace. When in those methods the 'job' method is no longer available, so it is recommended to pass in the current context to make this method available to other context. For example, when making utility methods, you would call them like this:

```groovy
BuildFramework.ant(this, arg1, arg2)
```

Then the BuildFramework class has enough to make 'job' calls, it would look like this:

```groovy
public class BuildFramework {
    public void static ant(jobFactory, arg1, arg2) {
        jobFactory.job {
            name arg1
            steps {
                ant(arg2)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

TBD, Current this method is hard-coded to free-form and maven projects. It wouldn't be too hard to make it implement multi-job and ivy projects. File a bug if you'd find this useful.

# DSL Methods

This is the formal documentation of the available DSL methods. In the Closure provided to job there are a few top level methods, like label and chucknorris. Others are nested deeper in blocks which represent their role in Jenkins, e.g. the publishers block contains all the publisher steps. The one caveat is that scm and multiscm are mutually exclusive. Likewise, when using the scm block, only one scm can be specified.

Further sections will define in detail how they work, in a Java-like syntax. If an argument is followed with an equals, this means it's a default value. DSL Methods can be cumulative or overriding, meaning that some methods will add nodes (e.g. publishers and steps) and some will replace nodes (e.g. disabled() will replace any existing disabled tags).

**NOTE: when using these commands, remember that you need to use them in context.  I.e. to use the "downstream" command, it needs to be enclosed in a "publisher" command block.**

The plugin tries to provide DSL methods to cover "common use case" scenarios as simple method calls. When these methods fail you, you can always generate the XML yourself via the [configure block](The Configure Block). Sometimes, a DSL method will provide a configure block of its own, which will set the a good context to help modify a few fields.  This gives native access to the Job config XML, which is typically very straight forward to understand.

(Note: The full XML can be found for any job by taking the Jenkins URL and appending "/config.xml" to it. We find that creating a job the way you like it, then viewing the XML is the best way to learn what fields you need.)

# Job
```groovy
job(Map<String, Object> attributes=[:], Closure closure)
```

The above method will return a _Job_ object that can be re-used and passed around. E.g.

```groovy
def myJob = job {
    name 'SimpleJob'
}
myJob.with {
    description 'A Simple Job'
}
```

A job can have optional attributes. Currently only a 'type' attribute with value of 'Freeform', 'Maven', 'Multijob', or 'BuildFlow' is supported. When no type attribute is specified, a free-style job will be generated. Some methods will only be available in some job types, e.g. phase is meant only in Multijob. Each dsl method should document where they are relevant.

```groovy
job(type: Maven) {
  name 'maven-job'
}
```

Please see the [[Job Reference]] page for details to the _job_ component.

# View
```groovy
view(Map<String, Object> attributes=[:], Closure closure)
```

The view method behaves like the job method explained above and will return a _View_ object.

Currently only a 'type' attribute with value of 'ListView' is supported. When no type attribute is specified, a list view will be generated.

```groovy
view(type: ListView) {
  name 'project-view'
}
```

Please see the [[View Reference]] page for details.

# Folder
```groovy
folder(Closure closure)
```

The folder method behaves like the job method explained above and will return a _Folder_ object.

Folders will be created before jobs and views to ensure that a folder exists before entries are created.

```groovy
folder {
  name 'project-a'
  displayName 'Project A'
}
```

Items can be created within folders by using the full path as job name.

```groovy
folder {
  name 'project-a'
}

job {
  name 'project-a/compile'
}

view {
  name 'project-a/pipeline'
}

folder {
  name 'project-a/testing'
}
```

# Queue

```groovy
queue(String jobName)
queue(Job job)
```

This provide the ability to schedule a Job to be executable after the DSL runs. The given name doesn't have to be a job which was generated by the DSL, but it could be.

# Reading Files from Workspace
Requires version >1.15.
```groovy
InputStream streamFileFromWorkspace(String filePath) throws IOException;
String readFileFromWorkspace(String filePath) throws IOException;
```

Anywhere in the script you can read in a file from the current workspace using the above calls. This assumes that you checked out some source control as part of the job processing the DSL. This can be useful when populated fields on a generated job, e.g.

```groovy
job {
    steps {
        shell(readFileFromWorkspace('build.sh')
    }
}
```

# Grab

Groovy provides the ability to "grab" dependencies and use them right away, this is called Grape (http://groovy.codehaus.org/Grape). The Job-DSL supports this feature, as long as it's provided at the top of the script. Not only can the @Grab annotation be used, it can be used with @GrabResolver to pull dependencies from custom defined repositories. This means that you can write a set of conventions  specific to your Enterprise, jar them up, distribute them via a repository, then grab them via @Grab. Here is an example of pulling in a utility library.

```groovy
@Grab(group='commons-lang', module='commons-lang', version='2.4')
import org.apache.commons.lang.WordUtils
println "Hello ${WordUtils.capitalize('world')}"
```

#  Configure
_This is primarily defined in the [[configure block]] page. This is a short overview._

A lot of property directory on a project are best accessed directly with the configure block and via a DSL command.
Here are some simple examples:
```
configure {
    description 'My Description'
    jdk = 'JDK 6'
    disabled false
    labels 'MASTER' // Need way to disable too
}
```
