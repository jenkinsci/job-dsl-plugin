Over time unwanted Job DSL features are deprecated and eventually deleted. Deprecated features will be removed six month
after the release in which they are first deprecated. Job DSL scripts must be fixed before this time. Deprecated
features are listed on the [[Migration]] page under the release in which they are first deprecated. The console log of
the seed job will contain warnings when deprecated features are used. A release will be marked as incompatible in the
Jenkins Update Center if features have been removed.

If you have problems migrating, ask for help on the
[mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/job-dsl-plugin).
