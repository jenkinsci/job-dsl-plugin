    Define a whitelist if you would like to restrict the type of job dsl that is allowed to be processed to create new
    jobs.
    <h3>There are three types of job dsl blocks that you can define using the whitelist</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Publish, Step, Wrapper, and scm job dsl blocks</b>
            If you want to whitelist Publish, Step, Wrapper, and scm job dsl blocks, simply whitelist the class that
            defines the Perform method for that particular build, publish, wrapper, or scm plugin step. If you don't
            know this, or can't find the class path, simply run the Process JobDsl Step with Whitelisting turned on
            (just put a dummy class name in the text box), and the console output will indicate the class name that
            needs to be whitelisted for the job dsl to be processed successfully.

            <u>Example job dsl code:</u>(in this case, hudson.plugins.emailext.ExtendedEmailPublisher would need to be in the whitelist)
            job() {
                publish real thing... do email?
            }
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Publish, Step, Wrapper, and scm job dsl blocks defined in an External Helper Class</b>
            If you want to whitelist Publish, Step, Wrapper, and scm job dsl blocks, simply whitelist the class
            <u>Example job dsl code:</u>(in this case, helper.MyStepHelperClass would need to be in the whitelist)
            import helper.MyStepHelperClass

            job() {
                step myCustomStepDefinition()
            }
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Configure Blocks defined in an External Helper Class</b>
            If you want to whitelist configure job dsl blocks, you must pull these into an external class, and whitelist
            that class name. For more information on how to pull a re-usable configure block into an external, helper
            class, look at

            page
            <u>Example job dsl code:</u>(in this case, helper.MyConfigHelperClass would need to be in the whitelist)
            import helper.MyConfigHelperClass

            job() {
            configure myCustomConfigDefinition()
            }
        </li>
    </ul>
