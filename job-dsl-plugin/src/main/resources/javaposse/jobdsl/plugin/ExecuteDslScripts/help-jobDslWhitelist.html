    Add classes to this whitelist if you would like to restrict the type of job dsl that is allowed to be processed to
    create new jobs. Once one or more classes are added to the whitelist, whitelisting is "turned on" for this Process
    Job DSLs" step and if any dsl blocks attempt to be processed that are not whitelisted, this step will fail, and
    not create or update the job accordingly.<br/><br/>
    Whitelisting only supports a subset of job dsl blocks at the moment. Namely any dsl defined under step, publish,
    scm, or wrapper block can be whitelisted. In addition, you can whitelist config blocks if they are defined in an
    external class. For more details on how to whitelist these, see below. <br/><br/>
    If you want to use the whitelist feature, but need to allow dsl blocks outside of these types, you would need to
    contribute back to the job-dsl plugin to add support.
    <h3>The three types of job dsl blocks that can be whitelisted</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <b>publish, step, wrapper, and scm job dsl blocks defined directly in the DSL script - </b>
            If you want to whitelist publish, step, wrapper, or scm job dsl blocks, simply whitelist the class that
            defines the Perform method for that particular step, publish, wrapper, or scm plugin. <br/>If you don't
            know this, simply run the Process JobDsl Step with whitelisting turned on (just put a dummy class name in
            the text box), and the console output will error and spit out the class name that needs to be whitelisted
            for the job dsl to be processed successfully.<br/>

            <u>Example job dsl code:</u>(in this case, <i>hudson.plugins.emailext.ExtendedEmailPublisher</i> would need to be
            in the whitelist)<br/><br/>
            job() {<br/>
            &ensp;extendedEmail {<br/>
            &ensp;&ensp;recipientList('$DEFAULT_RECIPIENTS')<br/>
            &ensp;&ensp;defaultSubject('$DEFAULT_SUBJECT')<br/>
            &ensp;&ensp;defaultContent('$DEFAULT_CONTENT')<br/>
            &ensp;&ensp;contentType('default')<br/>
            &ensp;&ensp;triggers {<br/>
            &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;...<br/>
            &ensp;&ensp;}<br/>
            &ensp;}<br/>
            }
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>publish, step, wrapper, and scm job dsl blocks defined in an <i> External Helper Class</i> - </b>
            If you want to whitelist publish, step, wrapper, and scm job dsl blocks defined in an external class,
            simply whitelist the external class. For more information on how to put a re-usable dsl block into an
            external, helper class, look at
            <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/job-dsl-plugin/wiki/The-Configure-Block"> The Configure Block Wiki</a>
            page. <br/>
            <u>Example job dsl code:</u>(in this case, if closure myCustomStepDefinition() is defined in
            helper.MyStepHelperClass, <i>helper.MyStepHelperClass</i> that would need to be in the whitelist)<br/><br/>
            import helper.MyStepHelperClass<br/><br/>

            job() {<br/>
            &ensp;step myCustomStepDefinition()<br/>
            }
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Configure Blocks defined in an External Helper Class - </b>
            If you want to whitelist configure job dsl blocks, you must pull these into an external class, and whitelist
            that class name. For more information on how to pull a re-usable configure block into an external, helper
            class, look at
            <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/job-dsl-plugin/wiki/The-Configure-Block"> The Configure Block Wiki</a>
            page<br/>
            <u>Example job dsl code:</u>(in this case, if closure myCustomConfigDefinition is defined in the class
            helper.MyConfigHelperClass, <i>helper.MyConfigHelperClass</i> would need to be in the whitelist)<br/><br/>
            import helper.MyConfigHelperClass<br/><br/>

            job() {<br/>
            &ensp;configure myCustomConfigDefinition()<br/>
            }
        </li>
    </ol>
