    Determines how relative job names in DSL scripts are interpreted. You will only see a difference when
    the seed job is located in a <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/CloudBees+Folders+Plugin">folder</a>.
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Seed Job</b> is the default choice. If you choose this option relative job names in DSL scripts will be
            interpreted relative to the folder in which the seed job is located. Suppose you have a seed job which is
            located in a folder named <tt>seedJobFolder</tt> and a DSL script which creates a job named
            <tt>subfolder2/job</tt>. The job that is created by the seed job will be at the location
            <tt>/seedJobFolder/subfolder2/job</tt>.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Jenkins Root</b> provides backwards compatibility for jobs created with plugin versions prior to 1.23.
            When this option is selected relative job names are always interpreted relative to the Jenkins root. For the
            seed job and DSL script from the previous example the job will be created at the location
            <tt>/subfolder2/job</tt>.
        </li>
    </ul>
