  This option forces a dry run that does everything but modify existing configuration and rather prints XML diffs to the console logs
  to be inspected.
  This mode is useful with pull request/feature branch building and staging to automatically validate and inspect the proposed change
  in the actual deployment environment. The latter allows to validate that external references (Credential IDs, Secret Files etc) are
  properly found and resolved.
