    This is a new line separated list<br/>
    If one or more classes are added to this whitelist, External Class Whitelisting is "turned on" for this Process
    Job DSLs step and if any dsl blocks are used that are defined in an exernal class that is not whitelisted,
    this step will fail, and not create or update the job accordingly.<br/>
    The only types of configure blocks supported are configure, steps, triggers, publishers, and wrappers. To add
    support for more types, contribute back to the job-dsl plugin<br/>
    For more information on how to pull a re-usable configure block into an external, helper
    class, look at
    <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/job-dsl-plugin/wiki/The-Configure-Block"> The Configure Block Wiki</a> page
    <br/><br/>

    <b>Example job dsl code: </b>(in this case, if the closures used below are defined in the external helper class -
    <i>helper.DSLConfigBlocks</i>, then <i>helper.DSLConfigBlocks</i> would need to be in the whitelist for this job dsl to be
    processed successfully)<br/><br/>

    import helpers.DSLConfigBlocks<br/><br/>

    job() {<br/>
    &ensp;configure DSLConfigBlocks.myCustomConfigDefinition()<br/>
    &ensp;steps DSLConfigBlocks.myCustomStepDefinition()<br/>
    &ensp;triggers DSLConfigBlocks.myCustomTriggerDefinition()<br/>
    &ensp;publishers DSLConfigBlocks.myCustomPublishDefinition()<br/>
    &ensp;wrappers DSLConfigBlocks.myCustomWrapperDefinition()<br/>
