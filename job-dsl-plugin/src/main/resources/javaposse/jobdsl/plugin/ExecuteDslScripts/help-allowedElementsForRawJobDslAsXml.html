    If any XML is added to this whitelist, Script DSL Whitelisting is "turned on" for this Process
    Job DSLs step and if any dsl blocks produce elements that are not called out in this whitelist,
    this step will fail, and not create or update the job accordingly.<br/><br/>
    <b>How the XML whitelist works: </b> This is based off of the xml that gets created from processing the job dsl.
    To specify your xml whitelist, you simply need to define what elements are allowed in the resulting config.xml
    and add the parent nodes to your whitelist xml. (this does not apply to any job dsl blocks defined in external
    classes. This whitelist is ONLY applied to job dsl directly in the script files)
    <ul>
        <li>Elements listed in the XML whitelist are allowed for that level in the tree</li>
        <li>A leaf node in the whitelist specifies that the job dsl script being processed can produce any number of
            children of any type underneath that leaf node.</li>
    </ul>

    <b>Example xml whitelist: </b><br/><br/>

    &#60;project&#62;<br/>
    &ensp;&#60;description/&#62;<br/>
    &ensp;&#60;triggers/&#62;<br/>
    &ensp;&ensp;&#60;hudson.triggers.SCMTrigger/&#62;<br/>
    &ensp;&#60;/triggers&#62;<br/>
    &ensp;&#60;builders/&#62;<br/>
    &ensp;&#60;publishers/&#62;<br/>
    &#60;/project&#62;<br/>
    <br/>
    <b>What is allowed in the script DSL if we use the example XML above as our whitelist?</b> <br/>
        Using this Whitelist XML, a job can be created with any number and type of publishers, any number and type builders,
        a description, and ONLY triggers of type hudson.triggers.SCMTrigger, since that is the only child under the
        triggers element.<br/><br/>

<b>Additional Notes</b>
        <ul>
            <li>If you ONLY specify the root node, anything is allowed in the job dsl being processed (just as if you
                put nothing in this text box). This is because if the root node is empty, it is considered a leaf node,
                and any children are there for approved.
            </li>
            <li>Only element names are able to be whitelisted. You can leave element attributes in the whitelist xml,
                but it will not affect what is allowed in the job dsl script</li>
            <li>Some elements/default values come with the FreeStyleJob template (i.e. show up in the resulting
                config.xml without being specified in the job dsl being processed). These elements do not need
                to be added to the whitelist, and it will still process just fine.
                Only the elements that are produced by the job dsl script are affected by the whitelist</li>
        </ul>
