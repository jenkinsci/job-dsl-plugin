        If script security is <b>enabled</b>, users will need to wait for an administrator to approve Job DSL scripts or
        run scripts within a restricted sandbox. Importing classes from the workspace is not possible since the classes
        are not subject to the approval process. Entries in the "Additional classpath" also need to be approved and only
        JAR files are supported.
    </p>
    <p>
        If script security is <b>disabled</b>, any user can run arbitrary code within the Jenkins process (e.g.
        terminating Jenkins or undermining the security model). This includes users who are permitted to push Job DSL
        scripts to SCM repositories and thus may trigger jobs running a Job DSL build step.
    </p>
    <p>
        This setting is only effective if security is enabled.
